Python Curriculum
====================

This document contains ideas and lessons taught in a 10 week introductory
programming course. Each class is 90 minutes, providing around 15 minutes
flex-time for attendance and any student running late.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   intro
   variables
   conditionals
   functions
   review-with-trivia
   back-to-turtles
   exercises/fix-program
   exercises/bagels


The course is taught to various groups of students aged 11-13 and is taught with
the assumption of basic computer skills (using a web browser, mouse, and
keyboard). For most of the students, this is the first time they are doing any
formal computer programming.

Since visual aids are important, we take advantage of the Python ``turtle``
module. The module is available on all Python installations, but Ubuntu users
may have trouble. If you do, try installing the TK module.

.. sourcecode:: python

   sudo apt-get install python3-tk

This is a living document. After a couple of years of teaching Scratch, we have 
decided to try Python, and thus not all lesson plans are laid out. The idea
behind this is to document the curriculum so it can be used, and refined, in
future semesters.

We found the best approach to teaching was to have the students turn their
monitors off whenever a lesson was being given.

Please feel free to contribute by exploring the lessons already laid out, adding
your insight where you please.

Much of the lessons in this curriculum are inspired from various sources, but
especially `Python For Kids <https://www.nostarch.com/pythonforkids>`_, by Jason
R. Briggs.
