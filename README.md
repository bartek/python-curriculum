# python-curriculum

This document contains ideas and lessons taught in a 10 week introductory
programming course. Each class is 90 minutes, providing around 15 minutes
flex-time for attendance and any student running late.

The course is taught to various groups of students aged 11-13 and is taught with
the assumption of basic computer skills (using a web browser, mouse, and
keyboard). For most of the students, this is the first time they are doing any
formal computer programming.

The curriculum is prepared using Sphinx. You'll want to clone the repository and
install Sphinx to get it running locally.

    git clone git@github.com:bartek/python-curriculum.git
    cd ./python-curriculum
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    make html
    cd ./_build/html
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Please feel free to contribute by exploring the lessons already laid out, adding
your insight where you please.
